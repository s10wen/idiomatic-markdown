First there was [idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js), then there was [idiomatic-css](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css), now I bring you **idiomatic-markdown**.

I've added a few starting ideas listed below, I'm interested to see what other people think, please feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues for discussion.
